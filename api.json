      "full": "Goblins are small supernatural creatures from European folklore, typically depicted as grotesque, mischievous, or malevolent beings. Standing 1-3 feet tall with greenish or gray skin, long fingers, and pointed ears, they inhabit caves, underground spaces, forests, and ruins. Their behavior ranges from mischievous pranks to outright malevolence, often stealing and hoarding treasure, causing minor chaos, and tormenting humans. Some traditions describe helpful goblins, though most emphasize their troublesome nature. Goblins are cunning, tool-using, and often organized in groups. They possess minor magical abilities, weakness to iron and sunlight in some traditions, and have become archetypal small monsters in modern fantasy literature and games."
